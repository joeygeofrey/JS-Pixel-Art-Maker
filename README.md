# JS-Pixel-Art-Maker

In this project I am deploying <b>HTML, CSS and JavaScript</b> to create a Pixel Art Maker.

This pixel art maker requires two user inputs: grid height and grid width, in order to construct a design canvas. 

The user creates the design canvas by clicking create button.

Once the design canvas has been created, the user is now able to select a color of their choice to draw their masterpiece.

The user may clear the grid by clicking the create button once again.

To use Pixel Art Maker, you must be using the current version of Edge, Firefox, or Chrome.

## Running the Pixel Art Maker

To run this program, please open `index.html` in a supported browser.
